# Landing page

A simple landing page, part of Udacity's course. The HTML and CSS was provided by Udacity through the following repository.

A lot of liberties were taken in this submission of course.

## app.js

This is the part I actually did from scratch. it does a few things among which is controlling the navbar and dynamically generating a few elements.
